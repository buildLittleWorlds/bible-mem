# Bible Memory Palace

Bible Memory Palace is a web application designed to help users memorize Bible verses using the memory palace technique combined with spaced repetition.

## üéØ For Users

### What is Bible Memory Palace?

Bible Memory Palace is a tool that helps you memorize Bible verses more effectively. It uses two powerful techniques:

1. **Memory Palace**: This technique involves associating each verse with a specific image (a painting) and location (locus). This creates strong visual memories, making verses easier to recall.

2. **Spaced Repetition**: The app schedules reviews of your verses at optimal intervals. As you become more confident with a verse, the time between reviews increases.

### How to Use

1. **Add Verses**: Start by adding verses you want to memorize. For each verse, you'll provide:
   - The Bible reference (book, chapter, verse)
   - A painting to associate with the verse
   - The artist of the painting
   - A description of a specific location or detail in the painting (locus)

   Note: The system automatically associates paintings with specific hex ranges. Each painting corresponds to a range of 16 loci (xxx0:xxxF in hex), where xxx represents any three hex digits.

2. **Review**: Regularly check the app for verses due for review. During review:
   - You'll see the painting(s) and locus description(s) associated with the verse or passage
   - Try to recall the verse(s)
   - Rate your confidence in your recall

   You can review individual verses or entire passages. The system will automatically determine which painting(s) to display based on the hex range of the verses being reviewed.

3. **Track Progress**: The dashboard shows your overall progress, including:
   - Total verses memorized
   - Verses due for review
   - Recent activity

### Understanding the Hex Range System

The Bible Memory Palace uses a hexadecimal system to encode verse references and associate them with paintings and loci:

- Each half-verse is assigned a unique hex code.
- Hex codes in the range xxx0:xxxF (where xxx is any three hex digits) are always associated with the same painting.
- This means that a single painting is linked to 16 consecutive loci.
- When reviewing a passage, the system automatically determines which painting(s) to display based on the hex range of the verses in the passage.
- For example, if you review verses with hex codes from 239B through 23B8, the system will display three paintings: one for range 2390:239F, one for 23A0:23AF, and one for 23B0:23BF.

This system ensures a consistent association between verses, paintings, and loci, allowing for flexible review of both individual verses and longer passages.

## üñ•Ô∏è For Developers

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Astro, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Astro API routes (serverless functions)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

### Database Structure

The app uses a single table `bible_master` in Supabase with the following key columns:

| Column                  | Type      | Description                                    |
|-------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| id                      | integer   | Unique identifier for each verse               |
| decimal_code            | integer   | Numeric encoding for verse reference           |
| hex_code                | text      | Hexadecimal encoding for verse reference       |
| book                    | text      | Bible book name                                |
| chapter                 | integer   | Chapter number                                 |
| verse                   | text      | Verse number (can include 'a' or 'b' for half verses) |
| painting                | text      | Name of the associated painting                |
| artist                  | text      | Name of the painting's artist                  |
| painting_url            | text      | URL to the painting image                      |
| locus_description       | text      | Description of the specific location in the painting |
| original_text           | text      | The text of the verse                          |
| memorization_started_at | timestamp | When memorization of this verse began          |
| last_reviewed_at        | timestamp | When the verse was last reviewed               |
| next_review_at          | timestamp | When the verse is due for next review          |
| confidence_level        | integer   | User's confidence level (0-5)                  |
| review_count            | integer   | Number of times the verse has been reviewed    |
| ease_factor             | float     | Factor used in spaced repetition algorithm     |
| interval                | integer   | Days until next review                         |

### Key Components

1. **src/pages/index.astro**: Home page
2. **src/pages/add-verse.astro**: Page for adding new verses
3. **src/pages/review.astro**: Page for reviewing verses
4. **src/pages/dashboard.astro**: User's dashboard
5. **src/components/VerseDetailForm.astro**: Form for adding/editing verse details
6. **src/pages/api/update-verse-detail.ts**: API route for updating verse details
7. **src/pages/api/submit-review.ts**: API route for submitting verse reviews

### Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The app uses a modified version of the SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm. Key points:

- After each review, the user provides a confidence rating (0-5)
- Based on this rating, the `ease_factor` and `interval` are adjusted
- The `next_review_at` is set based on the new interval

### Hex Range System Implementation

The hex range system is a core feature of the Bible Memory Palace app:

1. **Hex Code Assignment**: Each half-verse is assigned a unique hex code.
2. **Painting Association**: Paintings are associated with ranges of 16 hex codes (xxx0:xxxF).
3. **Locus Mapping**: Each hex code within a painting's range corresponds to a specific locus in that painting.
4. **Review Logic**: When fetching verses for review, the system determines which painting(s) to display based on the hex codes of the verses being reviewed.
5. **Flexible Passage Review**: The system can handle reviews of single verses or longer passages spanning multiple paintings.

When implementing new features or modifying existing ones, ensure that this hex range system is respected and utilized appropriately.
